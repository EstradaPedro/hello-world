Learning how to use GitHub by creating something easy
Branches --> Makes a copy of the master branch to allow the person to use the code while not messing anything up
--> Any changes done to the Master branch can be used by the branches by downloading an update
--> When changes are done in the branch they merge together with the master 

Readme-Edit branch
To create it use the drop down menu from the master branch and type the name of the branch you want to create
The changes you make must be commited --> accepted.

To use Pull Requests go to the Pull requests tab
Click on the branch you want to merge and it will compare the branch to the master branch
Red means deleted lines and green means new lines

After a pull request is given the person running the master branch can either confirm or deny the request and if confirmed they can then delete the branch since it no longer has a use. The branch can be restored if needed.
